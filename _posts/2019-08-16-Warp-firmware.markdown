I am currently one of the maintainers of the Warp-firmware. Warp is "a hardware platform to support research in approximate computing, sensor energy optimization, and energy-scavenged
systems. Warp incorporates 11 state-of-the-art sensor integrated
circuits, computation, and an energy-scavenged power supply, all
within a miniature system that is just 3.6 cm×3.3 cm×0.5 cm. Warp’s
sensor integrated circuits together contain a total of 21 sensors with
a range of precisions and accuracies for measuring eight sensing
modalities of acceleration, angular rate, magnetic flux density (compass heading), humidity, atmospheric pressure (elevation), infrared
radiation, ambient temperature, and color. Warp uses a combination
of analog circuits and digital control to facilitate further tradeoffs between sensor and communication accuracy, energy efficiency, and
performance." According to this [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09241) authored by Dr Phillip Stanley-Marbell and Professor Martin Rinard.
