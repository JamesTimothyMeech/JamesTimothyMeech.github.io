I am a PhD student in the Physical Computation Laboratory at Cambridge University funded by the EPSRC through the sensors CDT. 

I have a background in general engineering (mechanical, civil, electrical and electronic) but mainly in electronics.

My research interests are non-uniform random number generation, asynchronous logic, FPGAs, MEMs sensors, wireless sensor networks, finite element modelling of MEMs and nanotechnology, embedded systems and implantable sensors.
